SECURITY ASSESSMENT
===================

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- 5 IP cameras from 2 different vendors detected
- Multiple IoT devices on the network
- Unknown devices present

HIGH RISK DEVICES:
- 192.168.31.13, 192.168.31.31, 192.168.31.102, 192.168.31.103, 192.168.31.151, 192.168.31.152
- All are IP cameras or IoT devices
- Common vulnerabilities: Default credentials, unencrypted communications, firmware bugs

SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
=========================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Change default passwords on all IP cameras
2. Update firmware on all IoT devices
3. Identify unknown devices (192.168.31.236, 192.168.31.249)
4. Implement network segmentation for IoT devices

NETWORK SECURITY MEASURES:
1. Enable WPA3 encryption on Wi-Fi
2. Implement MAC address filtering
3. Set up VLAN segregation for IoT devices
4. Configure firewall rules to block unnecessary traffic
5. Enable network monitoring and logging

DEVICE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. IP Cameras:
   - Change admin credentials
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Enable HTTPS/SSL encryption
   - Update to latest firmware
   - Disable remote access if not needed

2. Router/Gateway:
   - Update firmware
   - Change default admin password
   - Disable WPS if enabled
   - Enable access logging
   - Configure guest network for IoT devices
